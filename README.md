# Apply Lightweight Fine-Tuning to a Foundation Model

Lightweight fine-tuning is one of the most important techniques for adapting foundation models, because it allows us to modify foundation models for our needs without needing substantial computational resources.
## Project Summary
In this project, we will bring together all of the essential components of a PyTorch + Hugging Face training and inference process. Specifically, we will:

1) Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
2) Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning using the pre-trained model
3) Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
